# Metaheuristics-project

The objective is to solve different problems using metaheuristics. We have
2 discrete optimization problems and 6 continuous problems to solve.
For each function we report:
- The chosen algorithm and a justification of this choice
- The parameters of the algorithm
- The final results, both solution and fitness
- The number of function evaluations
- The stopping criterion
- The computational time
- The convergence curve (fitness as a function of time)

We want to solve two TSP problems.
One with 38 cities (Djibouti) and the other with 194 cities (Qatar).

We want to minimize the following functions:

-Shifted Sphere Function
-Schwefel's Problem
-Shifted Rosenbrock Function
-Shifted Rastrigin's Function
-Shifted Griewank Function
-Shifted Ackley Function
